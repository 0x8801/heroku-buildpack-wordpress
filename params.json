{"name":"heroku-buildpack-wordpress","body":"### Heroku buildpack: Wordpress\r\n\r\nA [Heroku buildpack](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpack) for [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org).  Current Nginx: 1.2.0 ([see compile options](https://github.com/mchung/heroku-buildpack-wordpress/blob/master/support/package_nginx)).  Current PHP: 5.4.1 ([see compile options](https://github.com/mchung/heroku-buildpack-wordpress/blob/master/support/package_php)).\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n\r\n    $ git clone git://github.com/mchung/wordpress-on-heroku.git wordpress\r\n    $ cd wordpress\r\n\r\n    $ ls wp-config.php\r\n    wp-config.php\r\n\r\n    $ heroku create --stack cedar --buildpack http://github.com/mchung/heroku-buildpack-wordpress.git wordpress_instance\r\n\r\n    $ git push heroku master\r\n    ...\r\n    -----> Heroku receiving push\r\n    -----> Fetching custom buildpack\r\n    -----> Wordpress app detected\r\n\r\n    $ heroku open \r\n    # Will open the fresh instance in your browser\r\n\r\n\r\nThe buildpack will detect a `Wordpress` app if a `wp-config.php` is located in the root directory.  \r\n\r\n### Constraints \r\n\r\nThe constraints that Heroku places on deployed Wordpress instances are documented on this customized version of [Wordpress on Heroku](http://github.com/mchung/wordpress-on-heroku).  This buildpack must be used in conjunction with Wordpress on Heroku.\r\n\r\n### Caveat\r\nEach time an app is redeployed, Heroku will fetch the latest buildpack from the buildpack's Git repository and execute the instructions in *compile* and *deploy* (but not *release*).  In this case, it means downloading the latest precompiled version of Nginx and PHP from an S3 bucket.\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n\r\nWhen the Wordpress instance starts up, it copies over several configuration files found in the `config` directory of [Wordpress on Heroku](http://github.com/mchung/wordpress-on-heroku). Since these files are stored in the Wordpress repo, they may be modified.  For example, to remove the PHP-FPM status page (available by default at /status.html), remove the directive from `nginx.conf.erb`.\r\n\r\n### Support\r\nThe `support` directory also contains a handful of compilation and deployment scripts to automate several processes, which are currently used for maintenance and management.\r\n\r\n* **package_nginx** - Used to compile and upload the latest version of Nginx to S3.\r\n* **package_php** - Used to compile and upload the latest version of PHP to S3.\r\n* **wordup** - Helper script. Used to create and destroy instances of Wordpress on Heroku.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMarc Chung (@mchung)\r\n","tagline":"Run Wordpress on Heroku - Sweet, right?","google":"UA-31205985-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
